Hello, my name is Ditya Athallah. I'm a 21-year-old Frontend Developer based in Indonesia who specializes in javascript and react.js. Since 2018, I've had a strong interest in software engineering and related fields, particularly web development. I've been studying web development for over four years. Actually, I've been in love with programming languages since I was in elementary school, and I still love them even though I'm not very good at them. <br /><br />

Aside from being interested in software engineering, I also enjoy graphic design and UI/UX work. Since 2017, I've worked in UI/UX and Graphic Design. I'm not sure why, but I adore it. <br /><br />

Because of my competitive nature, I frequently participate in hackathons or innovative competitions. In addition, I have previously won several awards in hackathons or other competitions. Such as: <br /><br />

- Become finalist of National Hackathon & Collaboration in Padjadjaran
  University Indonesia
- Become first place in Devday: Hackathon 2021
- And many others.. (kindly check my cv for other achievements)

<br />
That is my accomplishment, and I am looking forward to new opportunities and challenges.
So, if you have an interesting challenge for me, hit me up...
