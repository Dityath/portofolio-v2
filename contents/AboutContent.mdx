Hi, I'm Ditya Athallah, a Frontend Developer from Indonesia who loves Javascript and React.js. I've been interested in software engineering and web development since 2018, and I've been working on my skills for more than four years. I have a long history of computer programming and computer science that started when I was in elementary school, and I always want to learn more and get better. I can build responsive and user-friendly web apps with modern technologies and frameworks. <br /><br />

I also know some backend development, like making APIs with Next.js or Golang. I'm a problem-solver who can handle different kinds of challenges, both technical and non-technical. I have good research and analytical skills, and I can adapt to the work situations. <br /><br />

Because of my competitive nature, I frequently participate in hackathons or innovative competitions. In addition, I have previously won several awards in hackathons or other competitions. Such as: <br /><br />

- Become finalist of National Hackathon & Collaboration in Padjadjaran
  University Indonesia
- Become first place in Devday: Hackathon 2021
- And many others.. (kindly check my cv for other achievements)

<br />
I'm looking for a chance to use my skills and passion in a fun and rewarding environment.
So, if you have an interesting challenge for me, hit me up...
